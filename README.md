Easy steps for Learning C++

First we'll need to get CMake. Download it from https://cmake.org/download/

If you install this, open the Terminal application:
type: `which cmake`
and this should print out something like:
/usr/local/bin/cmake

This tutorial is a big branch.
To get started you need to copy it to your computer.
Open terminal, find a directory (folder) and type
`cd <name-of-folder>` or type `cd` and drag your folder in.
Then type
`git clone https://github.com/namespacewizard/spells.git`

You should also get git gui
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Then checkout the first learning with
`git checkout spell1.0`
